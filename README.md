# Umi AI: A WebUI Wildcard Mod!

Umi AI is a wildcard mod that allows you to create randomized characters from random species with modular clothing types. It will grow over time and eventually become the ultimate character randomizer and creator.

Umi replaces the [Dynamic Wildcards extension](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui-wildcards). It has all the same functionality, plus more. Umi also conflicts with the [Unprompted extension](https://github.com/ThereforeGames/unprompted). Pick one or the other.

Note that if you are reading this message a substantial amount of time after the date of Nov 13th, Umi may already have the majority of capabilities that Unprompted does. Additionally, it will almost certainly be easier to use. For example, what if you want to create a random choice of multiple options?

**Unprompted formatting**:

    Photo of a [choose]red|blue|yellow|green[/choose]-haired [choose]man|woman[/choose]

**Umi formatting**:

    Photo of a {red|blue|yellow|green}-haired {man|woman}

These two functions do exactly the same thing, but Umi's is smaller and easier to read. The goal of Umi is to be as easy to use as possible while providing consistently high-quality outputs of random characters and settings.
